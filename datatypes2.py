# python is a dynamically typed language
# python understands its data type at runtime, user need to add data type implicitly in a code
a.upper()
# to get the information of any method or any process valid in python
# we can use help() function
help(a.upper)
help(a.count)
# check total blocks present in str
len(a)
# Str supports indexing
# indexing means a dedicated number allocated to each block of a string
# to use index we have take [ ] square bracket
#a[index]
a[0]
# we have +ve and -ve index as well
# +ve indexing starts with Zero- Left to Right
# -ve indexing starts with -1 - Right to Left
