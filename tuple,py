Tuple
# syntax : ()
t = ()  # empty tuple
# Tuple has same features as that of list
# It accepts homo./hetro. data
a = (1,2,3,4) # data is of same type==> homo.
b = (1,23.22,4+5j,'vinay') # data is of different type==> hetro.
# Tuple supports indexing and slicing bcz background data structure is an Array
# access middle 2 elements from b
b[1:3]
# Tuple preserves sequence order
# duplicates are allowed in tuple
# Tuple is Immutable in nature
#----------------------------------------------------
# In data type we have 2 approaches
# 1. Mutable data types- in which we can directly perform the changes(add,update,remove,insert,del)
# Ex. List, Set, Dict
# 2. Immutable data types- in which we can't perform the change in the original object, change remain temp.
# Ex. Tuple,string, range,
# list is mutable
# lets try to change last eleement 30
p[-1] = 'Akshay'
# remove 10
p.remove(10)
# use insert(index,value) to add an element using index
p.insert(0,'LAXMI')
# lets try to understand Immutable concept
# in which user cant able to change in the original object
t = (10,20,30)
t
# lets replace last element
t[-1] = 'Shirdhar'
# Assignment: Tuple contains 2 method - count(object) and index(object) check these 2 methods.
# Tuple Packing and Unpacking
a = 100
b = 'archana'
c = 300
# Tuple Packing and Unpacking
a = 100
b = 'archana'
c = 300
# Unpacking- It is a process of separating the individual object ans store it in separate variable called as Unpacking
num1,name,num2 = nums
# Assignment: Check packing and unpacking for list as well.
